# Payslip Calculator - Final Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The application was not running correctly due to several configuration issues:

1. Incorrect path configurations in the built HTML files
2. Package.json scripts pointing to development mode instead of production mode
3. Missing dependencies in the packaged application

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Path Configuration
- Updated `vite.config.js` to use relative paths (`base: './'`)
- Verified that the built `dist/index.html` now uses relative paths (./assets/...)

### 2. Updated Electron Main Process
- Modified `main.js` to always load the built application files
- Removed conditional development/production loading logic
- Used `path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html')` for proper path resolution

### 3. Corrected Package.json Configuration
- Updated `package.json` in the packaged application to directly run Electron
- Added all necessary dependencies (react, react-dom, react-router-dom)
- Ensured "start" script points to "electron ."

### 4. Installed Dependencies
- Ran `npm install` in the packaged application directory
- Verified all dependencies are correctly installed

### 5. Created Proper Launch Scripts
- Created `start-app.bat` for easy application launching
- Updated setup package with all necessary files

## Final Package Structure
