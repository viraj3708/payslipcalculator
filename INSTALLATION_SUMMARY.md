# Payslip Calculator - Installation and Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The application was not running due to incorrect path configurations in the built HTML files. The paths were using absolute paths (starting with "/") instead of relative paths, which caused issues when running the application in Electron.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration
- Modified `vite.config.js` to set `base: './'` for relative paths
- This ensures that the built assets use relative paths instead of absolute paths

### 2. Updated Electron Main Process
- Modified `main.js` to use `path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html')` for proper path resolution
- This ensures Electron can correctly locate the built application files

### 3. Rebuilt the Application
- Ran `npm run build` to regenerate the application with correct relative paths
- Verified that the built `dist/index.html` now uses relative paths

### 4. Created Proper Installation Package
- Packaged all necessary files in a clean directory structure
- Created installation scripts (`install.bat`, `uninstall.bat`) with proper administrator checks
- Added a `README.txt` with clear installation and usage instructions
