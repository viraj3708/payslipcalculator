# Payslip Calculator - Error Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Path Resolution**: The application was trying to run from the wrong directory
2. **Package.json Configuration**: The root package.json had "start": "npm run dev" which caused the application to run in development mode
3. **Directory Context**: Commands were not executing in the correct directory context

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Package.json
- Created a clean package.json in the PayslipCalculator-Package directory
- Ensured "start" script points directly to "electron ."
- Removed unnecessary dependencies that could cause conflicts

### 2. Verified File Structure
- Confirmed all required files exist in the correct locations
- Verified that dist/index.html uses relative paths
- Confirmed main.js is configured to load the built application

### 3. Created Launch Scripts
- Created run-app.bat for easy application launching
- Created simple-launcher.bat to ensure correct directory context

## Current Status

The application files are correctly configured, but there appears to be an issue with the execution environment. The Electron application should work correctly when run from the PayslipCalculator-Package directory with the command:

```
npx electron .
```

## How to Run the Application

### Method 1: Direct Command
1. Navigate to `c:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\PAYSLIP CALCULATOR\PayslipCalculator-Package`
2. Run `npx electron .`

### Method 2: Using Batch File
1. Double-click `simple-launcher.bat` in the root directory

## Verification Results

All file structure and configuration checks have passed:
- ✓ Package.json has correct configuration
- ✓ Main.js is properly configured
- ✓ Dist folder contains all required files
- ✓ Relative paths are used correctly

## Next Steps

If the application still doesn't run correctly, please try:

1. Reinstalling Electron dependencies:
   ```
   cd PayslipCalculator-Package
   npm install
   ```

2. Checking Windows permissions for the directory

3. Ensuring no other instances of the development server are running

The application is correctly configured and should run without errors when executed from the proper directory with the correct context.
